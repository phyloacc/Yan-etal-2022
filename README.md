Data and scripts for the upcoming publication of the gene tree model.

Note that max file size for github repos is 100MB.

Please upload files related to the project here, ideally in a way that the scripts could be run easily just after cloning the repo!

I am open to any sort of organization/re-organization of the file system, I just wanted to get us started with this:

`data/`: Any input data that will fit in the repository (trees, alignments, simulated data, etc.).

`results/mammals/`: Any results files from the mammal data, including raw phyloacc files and also summary files used to make figures.

`results/ratites/`: Any results files from the ratite data, including raw phyloacc files and also summary files used to make figures.

`results/simulations/`: Any results files from the simulations, including raw phyloacc files and also summary files used to make figures.

`scripts/`: Any code used to summarize or analyze results or to generate figures.
